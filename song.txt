My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son but it's so
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
My what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My what a good day for a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son but it's so
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty going toe to toe
My what a good day for a let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
